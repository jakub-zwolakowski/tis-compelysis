# Tools

## CodeChecker

**CodeChecker** is a static analysis infrastructure built on the [LLVM/Clang Static Analyzer](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) toolchain, replacing `scan-build` in a Linux or macOS (OS X) development environment.

## clang-tidy

**clang-tidy** is a clang-based C++ “linter” tool. Its purpose is to provide an extensible framework for diagnosing and fixing typical programming errors, like style violations, interface misuse, or bugs that can be deduced via static analysis. clang-tidy is modular and provides a convenient interface for writing new checks.
